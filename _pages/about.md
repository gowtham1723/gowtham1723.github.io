Iâ€™m Gowtham Premananth. I earned my Bachelor of Science honors degree in Engineering specializing in Computer Engineering from the University of Jaffna, Sri Lanka, in 2021. Currently, I am pursuing a Ph.D. in Electrical and Computer Engineering at the University of Maryland - College Park, where I have the privilege of working with [Prof. Carol Espy-Wilson](https://isr.umd.edu/clark/faculty/391/Carol-Espy-Wilson).

My research focuses on speech communication, where I integrate concepts from digital signal processing, speech science, linguistics, computer vision, and machine learning. Currently I am conducting interdisciplinary research that explores the detection and monitoring of various mental health disorders through human speech as a part of the [Speech Communication Laboratory](https://scl.umd.edu/) in the [Institue of Systems Research](https://isr.umd.edu/) at University of Marland - College Park.
