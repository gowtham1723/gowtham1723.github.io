Welcome to my website! 
Iâ€™m Gowtham Premananth. I earned my Bachelor of Science honors degree in Engineering specializing in Computer Engineering from the University of Jaffna, Sri Lanka, in 2021. Currently, I am pursuing a Ph.D. in Electrical and Computer Engineering at the University of Maryland, College Park, where I have the privilege of working with Carol Espy-Wilson.

My research focuses on speech communication, where I integrate concepts from digital signal processing, speech science, linguistics, computer vision, and machine learning. I aim to conduct interdisciplinary research that explores the detection and monitoring of various mental health disorders through human speech.
